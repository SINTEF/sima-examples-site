|xref:attachment$examples/SIMA_4.8/IEA15MW.stask[Model of the 15MW IEA Wind turbine]
|This is a SIMA model of the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine. The model is based on the windIO specification of turbine, with aerodynamic properties taken from the openFAST model. Documentation of the model verification is included in the storage task *ModelVerificaton* in the model file, and can also be accessed from here: xref:attachment$examples/SIMA_4.8/IEA15MWDocumentation.pdf[IEA 15 MW verification]. **_NOTE:_** The turbulent wind files included with the model are intended as an example only. The resolution is not sufficient to be used for actual response analysis.

|This example show how you can run the analysis, store the results to files and the finally post-process the data

|xref:attachment$examples/SIMA_4.8/sima481_Spar_OWT_DNV.stask[FOWT, Time domain VIV (Cross flow load)]
|This example shows how to include the effect of VIV due to wave & current in a time domain simulation. A FOWT is modelled including workflows and a small custom editor to run the analysis and view results. **NOTE**: _The purpose of this model is to illustrate the effect of VIV loads_. A check has been performed to ensure that the hydrodynamic coefficients are reasonable. This example was collaboratively created with the assistance of https://www.dnv.com/services/marine-operations-and-mooring-analysis-software-sima-2324[DNV^]. *Only cross-flow VIV loads are applied as the in-line loads are still restricted to the JIP participants.*
