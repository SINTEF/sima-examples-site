| [Model of the 15MW IEA Wind turbine](IEA15MW.stask)| This is a SIMA model of the IEA 15 MW reference wind turbine. The model is based on the windIO specification of turbine, with aerodynamic properties taken from the openFAST model. Documentation of the model verification is included in the storage task *ModelVerificaton* in the model file. <br/> <br/> **_NOTE:_** <br />  The turbulent wind files included with the model are intended as an example only. The resolution is not sufficient to be used for actual response analysis.|`wind` `IEA15MW`|
