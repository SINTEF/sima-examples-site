## Examples created for SIMA 4.6
  
###  SIMA 4.6.0

| Case | Description    |Tags|
|:---|:---|:---|
| [User defined element](CatenaryRiser_userdefined_element.stask)| This example shows to user a user-defined element to create a flat bottom. Fortran code for the user-defined element may be found in `template_code/earth_example.f90` and the compiled code in `earth_example.dll`. <br /> <br /> NOTE:  The interface code in Fortran 90 included in the storage task `template_code/earth_interface.f90` |`User defined element`|

### SIMA 4.6.3

|:---|:---|:---|
| [Time domain VIV (Cross flow load)](sima463_example_ttr500m.stask)| This example shows how to include the effect of VIV due to current and waves in a time domain simulation. <br />A simple TTR model is included together with workflows and a small custom editor to run the analysis and view results.<br /> <br /> Only cross-flow VIV loads are applied as the in-line loads are still restricted to the JIP participants. NOTE:  A license is currently needed to use cross-flow VIV loads. |`Time domain VIV, Cross-flow loads` <br /> `Wave & Current` <br /> `TTR (top tensioned riser)`|
| [Calculate relative distance between points](sima463_Calculate_relative_distance_between_points.stask)|This example shows how to use a workflow to calculate the relative distance between two points. This approach can be extended to find the relative distance between two bodies. | `workflow`, `transform point`, `relative position`,`bodies`
